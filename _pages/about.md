<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a first-year Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science and Technology at Anhui University, under the supervision of Professor Yiwen Zhang. I have been invited to serve as a reviewer for WWW, KDD, and IEEE TCSS. My research interests primarily focus on click-through prediction, multimodal data mining, and generative recommender systems:

1. **Click-through Prediction**: Click-through rate prediction is an important task for online advertising and recommendation, which aims to estimate the probability that a user will click on a certain item. Likewise, CTR prediction models have been widely applied to predicting users‚Äô like, favorite, purchase, or download actions. These tasks are usually formulated as a binary classification problem, which incorporates rich but heterogeneous (e.g., numerical, categorical, sequential) features extracted from user profiles, item attributes, and session contexts.
2. **Multimodal Recommender Systems**: Multimodal recommender systems are capable of utilizing multiple types of data (such as text, images, audio, and video) for recommendation. Unlike traditional methods that rely solely on single-modal information, such as user ID, item ID, multimodal recommendation integrates product descriptions, user reviews, images, audio, and other content from different modalities to enhance both the accuracy and diversity of recommendations.
3. **Generative Recommender Systems**: Generative recommender systems leverage auto-encoding models, auto-regressive models, and large language models to generate personalized recommendations. In contrast to traditional recommendation methods that primarily depend on user-item interaction data, generative models introduce novel paradigms for conceptualizing and delivering recommendations, enabling more flexible and creative recommendation strategies.
